1. Create java files to make this code compile and run.

2. What five objects are created in the main?
	An ArrayList of type Dog, Three dogs, and a Comparator of type Animal.
3. Can you spot the Comparator constructor call? Where is the class definition for the Comparator?
	It's the phrase "new Comparator<Animal>()." The class definition is contained in the java.util.Comparator that's imported at the top. The definition itself isn't contained in the file MyCompare3.
